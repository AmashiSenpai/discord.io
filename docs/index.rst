   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the documentation of discord.io.

Discord.io is a pre-alpha, bug-prone, and low-level Discord wrapper for Python.

Scope for the Framework
------------------------

We're aspiring to not just become a library or wrapper for Discord Bots, but a **framework.**

This means one framework of libraries built by discord.io to provide a truely uplifting experience.

This also means to us *being open for modification*, hence the implementation of our `impls`.
They work as a way to implement your own versions of our cache, models, etc. Although, they are still in early
conception and may be redone/removed later on.

Guide
-----

Currently we have no Guide. But stay tuned! We'll be working on one later...

Manuals
-------

Discord.io provides an index of its entire API for users to peruse. This details the specifics of classes and other objects
such as their functions, parameters, etc.
